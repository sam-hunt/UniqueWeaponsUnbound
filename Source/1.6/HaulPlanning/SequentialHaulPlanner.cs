    /// def it sorts candidate stacks by squared horizontal distance from the
    /// pawn and takes them in order until demand is met, emitting each picked
    /// stack as its own single-pickup trip. No batching, no encumbrance math,
    /// no awareness of the workbench position.
    ///
    /// Behaviorally identical to the pre-refactor inline implementation in
    /// WeaponModificationUtility.TryReserveIngredientsForJob — kept as the
    /// default so existing players see no change unless they opt in to one of
    /// the experimental planners. Pool sizing is exact-fit (multiplier 1.0,
    /// no cap) to preserve that equivalence: a richer pool would let this
    /// planner pick different (still-valid) stacks than today's behavior.
